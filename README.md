The above project is mainy made use to datasets The first dataset which is the data.csv is mainly consits of X and y coroodinates of eyes nose mouth and so on of different people. FIrstly on the dataset we performed data augmentation which in mainly inverting the x axis, y axis, incresing the brightness of the iages decreasing the brightness of the images and so. After perfroming the data augmentation on the data.csv we built a ResNET model for the dataset and saved the model built as a json file. For the second Dataset which is the icml_face_data.csv dataset we first performed data augmentation and then build a CNN model and saved the file as a json file. After building both the models we combined them and started predicting the emotion of the people in the dataset
